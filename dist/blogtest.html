    	        <p class="BlogTitle"><a href="http://blog.jeremypbeasley.com/post/150063532489/whole-assing-it">Whole ass'ing it.</a></p>
    	        <div class="regular_body" id="regular_body"><p>My dad worked harder than anyone I know. He set the bar and I credit him for much of what I consider to be my work ethic to be today. Beyond just working hard, he was constantly curious and full of projects. I remember a summer where he was building a Starbucks store, building a treehouse, sculpting a race track for our dirt bikes, remodeling our bathroom, and building a deck all at once. Never a dull moment.</p>

<p>I get a kick out of making things - all kinds of things. I find my curiosity to be the biggest driving factor in the decisions I make as a creative person. My interest in film has been huge over the last couple years and it&rsquo;s driven me into yet another creative outlet beyond design and coding interactive experiences for screens.</p>

<p>So here I am frustrated as hell on a Tuesday afternoon. I&rsquo;m wondering why I&rsquo;m left feeling so unsatisfied at work and every other venture of mine. Simply put: I&rsquo;m doing too much. At this moment I&rsquo;m leading the re-design and architecture of Starbucks.com, helping Canlis with a new website and creative strategy, directing and shooting a short documentary about a survivor of prostitution in Seattle, learning Node and two front end frameworks, studying cinematography, design and building a budgeting app with a few friends, and dabbling in getting into writing music again. All of this, of course, on top of raising three kids and spending ample time with the family exploring our new home in the beautiful Pacific Northwest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yikes. What is he thinking?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a variety of reasons why I&rsquo;ve arrived at this place but the biggest is due to a lack of realistically understanding my own limits. Of course, none of my crazy list above are &ldquo;bad&rdquo; things. In fact, there all wonderful things. Things that I enjoy, get to help people, and occasionally even profit financially from. Creativity can be quite arrogant for me. It&rsquo;s a bit of my own personal exhibition. Want a new challenge? Why not? This is not a new experience for me. At least twice a year I find myself completely underwater but continue repeating the same behavior that got me there the last time.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s this audacity that I think makes me good at what I do, but I also think it needs to stay in check. Saying &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to everything means saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; many other things, whether explicitly or not. I rarely sleep. I&rsquo;ve put on 20 pounds in the past year. My health is garbage. These are the things I tend to sacrifice without noticing it immediately. My wife will also tell you that when I&rsquo;m at my worst, it&rsquo;s her and the kids that suffer too.</p>

<p>The genius character Ron Swanson <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dzl-HalherjQ&amp;t=NTQxMmEzM2EzYWNkYjIzY2EzMGY4NmFjMDJlMzM4MWIxYzdmYzY4YiwyT0RiWVNaUA%3D%3D">once said</a> &ldquo;Never half-ass two things. Whole-ass one thing.&rdquo; I think about this often. Massimo Vignelli said &ldquo;One life is too short for doing everything.&rdquo; yet he also ironically (and rightfully) said &ldquo;If you can design one thing, then you can design everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For me, it&rsquo;ll never be as simple as refusing &ldquo;generalism&rdquo; and focusing on a single thing. Hell, I wish I could do that but it&rsquo;s extreme focus that will send me into an opposite but equally frustrating set of problems. So I suppose it&rsquo;s about balance and clearly understanding my priorities. I left the office for a walk today and wrote these things down on a napkin. 
1. Pick what&rsquo;s most important to you and do that. 
2. When you&rsquo;ve done all you can do with that thing, and if time allows, do the next thing. 
3. Don&rsquo;t do things that aren&rsquo;t important.
4. Don&rsquo;t take on or initiate projects out of a belief that now is the only time it can happen.</p>

<p>So, we&rsquo;ll see. I intend to write about this again once I&rsquo;ve taken a month or so to honestly attempt to live these out.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve enabled comments for the first time on my blog if anyone wants to chime in with your own thoughts.</p></div>

    	        <div class="regular_body" id="regular_body"><p>The arthritis I&rsquo;ve had in my knee for five years now, the dripping kitchen sink, the inevitability that my Volkswagen will cost me three thousand dollars this year, my messy basement, my inability to write out my thoughts on many issues that I&rsquo;m passionate about, my impatience towards things that don&rsquo;t change, my own contentment with how much of an asshole I am, my lack of relationship with my dad, the fact that I haven&rsquo;t seen him in 10 years, my son never knowing my father, my doubt that God exists and much less that he gives a shit about me, my broken headphones that I paid good money for, people around me who position themselves above others and are not really that impressive, the fact that America isn&rsquo;t as hunky dory as I grew up believing, my impulse to check Twitter being stronger reading a book, my tendency to let my own curiosities drive a conversation instead of learning about my friends and what interests them, every relationship I&rsquo;ve ruined because of my stupid pride, riding my bike uphill, the fact that my mom has cancer and there&rsquo;s little I can do about it, rent going up, my every growing dad belly, the construction on 23rd that killed our bus route for two years, the fact that I spent two years at a job I hated, how my talking with urban slang went from ironically funny to being a hard habit to break and generally awkward in professional environments, my inability to keep my mouth shut when something seems wrong or just silly, the way I spend more time trying to change things than just enjoying what I have, that thing I do where I only think about the future instead of reflecting on all the good stuff I have right now, most Republicans, most Democrats for that matter, arrogant religious people, businessmen with agendas, biz devs, the price of gas, how I don&rsquo;t respect my wife, beets, and Linkedin.</p>

<p>But then there&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>

<p>Spring time, biscuits, the fact that my mother while sick is not dead and in quite good spirits, my income having tripled since my son was born, my fake Eames chair, our perfect house in the Central District, my friends who&rsquo;ve moved to Seattle from the Lesser Cities, my son reading a book aloud in the next room, my daughter&rsquo;s inspiring drawings of distant worlds, my city that isn&rsquo;t perfect but is trying to love its people, the many wise older men who I can call on in hards time&rsquo;s in lieu of a dad that gives a shit, the memories I have with my grandma, various cheeses, HTML and CSS, health insurance, art, my mother&rsquo;s determination to put character over skill when I was growing up, the Volkswagen and all the awesome little adventures we&rsquo;ve had and will continue to have in it, my beautiful kids, summer in Seattle, Second Beach, being able to work with the finest group of designers and overall men I&rsquo;ve had in my career, Ellenos greek yogurt, black denim, the fact that despite my wanderings my wife is still with me and loves me very much. The fact that by God&rsquo;s grace I&rsquo;m almost certain I&rsquo;m less of an asshole than I was a year or two ago, good blogs, all the rad people on the internet that I&rsquo;ve never met that inspire me to be a better designer and even a better person, the fact that our lease includes someone to cut my grass, my huge credenza that cost me only twenty dollars, my wonderful and perfectly contentious siblings, ham, ham, bacon, being in a place where I can help others find the same success I have, being able to continually redefine what success means, being able to work towards a future without being a slave to it, the present, the lovely sweet here and now, cool rain, everything great my grandma taught me, the good things about the South, Christians who are actually Christ-like, any stout on nitro, the smell of Amy&rsquo;s hair, my feisty unborn son, my quaint backyard, the way the sun sometimes surprises us on winter mornings, being able to bike to work, not having been seriously injured by a car on the road (yet), bike lanes, people who respect bike lanes, my son&rsquo;s school, the ability to pay for my son&rsquo;s school, all the amazing nature that surrounds Seattle, waterfalls, good birds, Georgetown, Chase letting me complain about things for years now, local atmospheric bands, my variety of Chuck Taylor&rsquo;s, Bill Murray, never having gone without food - ever, Apple, punk rock, minimalism, excessive pinball outings with my son, Joseph for bearing the weight of the world but also mine, Jenn for pressing on, grace, wisdom, warm baths, the beach, Zeitgeist Coffee, the work ethic my father displayed for me as a kid, my mom&rsquo;s servanthood, my three years in a third world country and how it gave me a better perspective on the world, the nonsensical songs Owen makes up on the way to school every morning, last.fm for never letting me forget about my Coldplay stage, everyone who gave a rip to be patient with my ignorance and busyness as a kid, every rent check I paid with money made from myspace layout customizations, ferry rides for the sake of themselves, yves klein blue, and the Oatmeal Squares that nearly sustained my wife and I in our first year of marriage.</p>

<p>&mdash; As it happens, the glass is actually, very much half full. I have much to be thankful for.</p></div>

    	        <p class="BlogTitle"><a href="http://blog.jeremypbeasley.com/post/125825152909/a-recovering-workaholics-confession-or-spring-in">A recovering workaholic&rsquo;s confession (or spring in summer)</a></p>
    	        <div class="regular_body" id="regular_body"><p>It feels like spring. A new season for my life in so many ways.</p>

<p>Yet in all of this, I feel stuck.</p>

<p>Over the past decade, I&rsquo;ve designed album packaging and apparel for some of my favorite music artists, started a clothing company making t-shirts basically from scratch, and worked on webites and marketing for some of the largest companies and organizations in the country. Many of you reading know me as the creator of those things and these things have afforded me so many great connections and deep relationships with amazing people.</p>

<p>If you would have told me eight years ago I&rsquo;d be able to accomplish all of that by now, I don&rsquo;t know if I would have believed you. If I did believe you, I think I&rsquo;d be quite impressed with myself. I might even beat my chest a little while you weren&rsquo;t looking. No, I definitely would.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been working for half a decade only to feel more meaningless than ever as it relates to my work. All the same things I struggled with in my first years are still top of mind. &ldquo;what do I do with all this disjointed work?&rdquo;, &ldquo;what kind of designer do I really want to be?&rdquo;, &ldquo;what kind of designer do I want to be percieved as?&rdquo;. Much of my career, aside from the work I was actually producing, was done quite fearfully as I &ldquo;curated&rdquo; my own &ldquo;personal brand&rdquo; or whatever I percieved to be a successful designer. Fear has undoubtably been a dominating motivator in the majority of work-related decisions I&rsquo;ve made up until recently.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I took a spontaneous trip to the Oregon Coast with my family. The kind of trip I would have dreamed about a decade ago. When I came back to reality, something clicked. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m ready to call bullshit on all of this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I need to change.</p>

<p>I want to stop striving, stop hurrying. I&rsquo;m tired of running constantly towards a finish line. I&rsquo;m ready to slow down and be a thoughtful, decent, and caring human being. I&rsquo;m ready to start making descisions not as it directly relates to building my own little empire as much as how much my service can benefit the people around me.</p>

<p>Something big is happening in my heart and in my mind. I&rsquo;m starting to view my work as an expression of my identity rather than my identity itself.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m willing to accept that I have no idea where I&rsquo;m headed. I&rsquo;m willing to accept that the &ldquo;what does Jeremy even do?&rdquo; question might be forever difficult to answer. I&rsquo;m willing to accept that no matter what I labor for in my career, nothing will ever bring me the ultimate satisfaction that I should be pursuing with my wife, children, and family. I&rsquo;ll continue to work deligently, contributing my best thoughts and abilities and be patient as I progress.</p>

<p>Maybe this is a commitment to myself. Maybe it&rsquo;s my sideways way of me acknowledging my desperate need for grace. Maybe it&rsquo;s just a dumb blog post that no one will read. I don&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>Right now, I&rsquo;m thankful to have a job working with people I respect on a project I find interesting. Still, I have no idea where all this is going or what it&rsquo;s all adding up to.  Frankly, I&rsquo;m just really happy to be here and grateful to get to be the one to watch it all play out.</p>

    	        <div class="regular_body" id="regular_body"><p>I&rsquo;ve been designing / building for the web for nearly eight years now. Over that time I&rsquo;ve experimented with lots of different processes and developed a very strong point of view on how my team and I do our best work. A few fellow designers and developers have encouraged me to share publicly some of my thoughts on what has worked and what hasn&rsquo;t. This is my attempt to begin a much longer conversation on ideals, process, and methods surrounding designing for the web.</p>

<p>I plan to eventually write in detail about the process of creating a website step-by-step (maybe even with a real client), but for now I want just address some overarching ideals.</p>

<h3>Design with Purpose</h3>

<p>This may seem obvious but I can&rsquo;t count the times I&rsquo;ve been in conversations with a client or agency team saying &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s make a website!&rdquo; without much strategic reasoning or justification for it. You&rsquo;re welcome to apply what you&rsquo;re about to read below to the way you work but I promise it&rsquo;ll be all for naught unless you&rsquo;re not completely convinced the website in question should exist and it&rsquo;s purpose for existing is a good one. I believe firmly in <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FSturgeon%2527s_law&amp;t=Y2EwZWU3N2RjODNhYzQ1OTVmNDRlOTkxZTNiZTJhZGUwZWViOGNiNSxNM3UzaTM0aw%3D%3D">Sturgeon&rsquo;s Law</a> and we should all do our best to be sure that the things we&rsquo;re putting out into the world serve a purpose and are designed accordingly.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also worth noting that while the balance between personal expression and brand expression in digital design will be forever a debate, every decision you make throughout the process of designing and building should be filtered through the question &ldquo;does this serve or the purpose and goals of this website?&rdquo; If at any point personal expression stops aiding the purposes of the website, you should stop immediately and re-evaluate.</p>

<h3>Design in Progression</h3>

<p>I think about making a website like carving a figure from a block of wood. Here&rsquo;s a look at <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.walpoth.com%2Fwood.html&amp;t=MWJmMTA5N2M2ZDk3ZTZlYzJkNDk3YWFkMjczMzkzZGI0N2MwOWJmMSxNM3UzaTM0aw%3D%3D">Bruno Walpoth&rsquo;s</a> process of making his piece <em>Julia</em>.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Wmk0Ypp.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>A carver has a particular order in which he or she goes about creating say, for the sake of example, a human figure. It would be quite odd to see a large chunk of wood with a neatly crafted and fully featured face without much of any progress on the greater body. The carver begins with a very rough and hardly distinguishable figure and then slowly chips away until the human features being to gently reveal themselves.</p>

<p>Every time I complete a project, it&rsquo;s more and more clear that I should be iterating on the website in such a way as not to focus too much at one time on a particular feature, function, or area rather be looking at the website as a whole throughout the entire process. The details should come together at a steady pace across the entire site, not letting one area get too far ahead of the other. Spending time at the beginning of designing any website in the little details or anything heavily stylistic almost always results in wasted time on my part.</p>

<h3>Design with Substance</h3>

<p>Typography, space, color, weight, and even certain details of a layout should always come second to having a secure foundation of content, interactions, and messaging that meets the purpose and goals of the website. Designing fully stylized pages based with only a hunch of what the client might need or what maybe another similar client might need and then pumping it full of Lorem Ipsum is a waste of your time and ultimately won&rsquo;t lend to the best product in the end. At the end of the day, no one cares about our cool fonts and hover effects if they can&rsquo;t find what the they came to this website to find.</p>

<p>I believe a big reason why content is so often overlooked in the beginning of making a website is because people generally avoid hard work. Work through copy, messaging, and user flows with your client before ever distracting them with the emotional response to type, colors, or specific layouts.</p>

<h3>Design in Context</h3>

<p>Historically speaking, web designers built flat images (often in Photoshop) then handed them to developers to &ldquo;develop&rdquo; it. When responsive design and increased traffic from mobile devices came into consideration, web designers continued to follow this same process but created separate images for desktop, tablet, and mobile, sometimes tripling their workload. While that may have worked for a time, the &ldquo;edgelessness of the web&rdquo; as Frank Chimero <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Ffrankchimero.com%2Fwriting%2Fthe-webs-grain%2F&amp;t=YjY0ZTUzMjAzMzg2NGVhNWMzYTRkODJiN2I5OGY4MTdjMTJjYTQzYixNM3UzaTM0aw%3D%3D">describes it</a>, has proven this process completely obsolete. For more on this topic, I&rsquo;d recommend reading Brad Frost&rsquo;s <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fbradfrost.com%2Fblog%2Fweb%2Fresponsive-web-design-missing-the-point%2F&amp;t=MzAzN2I4ODQ5ZTQ2YmVmMzlhY2JmMTMxZmU1MmU2NjE3YzQ3YjFjMyxNM3UzaTM0aw%3D%3D"><em>Responsive Design Is Missing the Point</em></a></p>

<p>While some will argue against it&rsquo;s necessity, a web designer is exponentially more capable of producing their best designs if they learn how to code it themselves. As screen sizes change, there are simply too many variables that a flat image can never account for. Once a web designer can learn to design layouts with relativity in mind and graduate from fixed dimensions and pixel units, an entire new world opens up.</p>

<p>Designing in context (or in the browser) accomplishes a few important things:</p>

<p>1.) it enables the designer to be thorough and clear regarding the many thousands of tiny decisions that go into building a great website. There is no endless back and forth, nor well-intentioned guesses from developers who may not be quite sure of the intentions of the designer.</p>

<p>2.) it enables the designer to experiment, with a level of experimentation and agility that no other process can provide. Designing in a flat environment guarantees so many missed opportunities for designing the interactive details of everything from forms and buttons to backgrounds and other interactive elements. Designing in context means getting to actually design the details. As Mr. Eames said, &ldquo;The design is the details.&rdquo;</p>

<p>3.) it allows the designer to quickly validate their design decisions through user testing and data-driven analysis. A prototype is the first step to knowing you actually did your job. <a href="https://twitter.com/pitaru">Amit Pitaru</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/ekeneijeoma/status/605848906065309696">said</a> that &ldquo;Prototypes are conversations between designers and engineers&rdquo; and I couldn&rsquo;t agree more other than to throw &ldquo;users&rdquo; in the mix. Good design accomplishes it&rsquo;s goals and you&rsquo;ll never know that to be true without testing. Designing in context allows you to test more thoroughly and earlier than any other approach in my experience.</p>

<p>There are many tools which help bridge this gap like <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fmacaw.co%2F&amp;t=NDk4NGI1OGIwZTc3ZWI3NWNlMjk4MDVmYWE4Zjc2NjU1NGU1OTNkNSxNM3UzaTM0aw%3D%3D">Macaw</a> and <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fbohemiancoding.com%2Fsketch%2F&amp;t=N2JhMDllZjNlMGU5YmYyMDU0ODM0MzU4NTcyNzZjOWI0ODljMjk2ZCxNM3UzaTM0aw%3D%3D">Sketch</a>, but after using them on and off for over a year, I&rsquo;m not convinced they will ever be a match for a designer being able to design right in the context of the browser itself.  These tools simply don&rsquo;t afford the designer enough influence over the final product nor do they produce the level of code that could and should be produced for a quality, optimized user experience.</p>

<p>Also, if you can do a good job of explaining this process to your clients, most will respond very well to the idea of being able to &ldquo;hold&rdquo; their website as it moves along in the process. Imagine how frustrating it must be to pay so much money for something and then have to wait months to actually get the satisfaction of playing with your new purchase. Be empathetic. Getting a version of the site at any stage in a browser and live to access remotely can be a huge relief and great way to appease an overbearing client.</p>

<p>Brad Frost would go as far as to argue that front end <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fbradfrost.com%2Fblog%2Fpost%2Fdevelopment-is-design%2F&amp;t=NjEwMzc5MTQzNzBiNTIzZDdjOTYzMzgyZWYyOGMxMWYxODFhM2NhMCxNM3UzaTM0aw%3D%3D">&ldquo;development <em>is</em> design&rdquo;</a>. After years of seeing this play out, I couldn&rsquo;t agree with him more.</p>

<h3>Design for Speed</h3>

<p>You spend weeks, months, years making a fantastic website and the unfortunate truth is that your audience, no matter who they are, give a mere few seconds to your content. The attention span of people on the web appears to be decreasing every year consistently. This eerily prophetic <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fnews.bbc.co.uk%2F2%2Fhi%2F1834682.stm&amp;t=MWRiZmEwNWExYTZkMDJjMzZjYzEyZjgyNWQ4OGMzNTc0M2U5ZDIwMCxNM3UzaTM0aw%3D%3D">article</a> from 2002 paints of a picture of the modern web user and their attention span of less than nine seconds - shorter than that of a gold fish.</p>

<p>In my personal experience, to get more than 2 minutes of time on any website was a huge accomplishment. However you choose to do it, at the point in which you begin to translate your content into a styled form (even a <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fbradfrost.com%2Fblog%2Fpost%2Fhtml-wireframes%2F&amp;t=OGJiYjc5YjZlNGIxMjI1OGUxNWZjMjMwZWVmODg5ZDc3YmIwOTAzNyxNM3UzaTM0aw%3D%3D">wireframe</a>) you immediately have to begin thinking about speed.</p>

<p>Technically speaking, every detail should be taken into consideration. To borrow from a <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.somerandomdude.com%2F2012%2F02%2F21%2Fdesign-for-speed%2F&amp;t=NjEzNzg0NWMwMGMwMDE4NGFhMThhMjFhMjdlYmI4NWUyODhkZDA5NCxNM3UzaTM0aw%3D%3D">great article</a> by P.J. Onori, we have to realize that speed has traditionally been considered a problem for engineering and all but ignored by most designers. You must consider time as a core dimension of user experience. Every pixel on the screen needs to be accounted for, every interaction justified. That same approach should be taken towards speed. Each image that loads, every font and glyph, every byte and query added should be intentional and markedly improving the experience. If not, it should be gone.</p>

<p>If you have <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F12933%2Fwhat-you-think-you-know-about-the-web-is-wrong%2F&amp;t=NjViZjkzMGI2NTliYmVhNjI2ZjUyYTZlM2ZjZjM2NGRiMDNmODIyOSxNM3UzaTM0aw%3D%3D">15 seconds</a> to make get your message across or get a visitor to take a specific action, what will you change? What will you cut? What will you reorder or reorganized for faster, easier access?</p>

<h3>Design it, again.</h3>

<p>When designing for the web, your work is never really done. Even the best web designer&rsquo;s first shot isn&rsquo;t really their best shot. I can&rsquo;t count the times I have designed something and found that users didn&rsquo;t interact with it at all in the way I&rsquo;d expected. Almost any website you make should take into account some plan for continued improvement.</p>

<p><a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fheapanalytics.com%2F&amp;t=ZmU5ZDZkN2QyZGVhZDg4ODE5OGJlMjQ4NGFhNTFkYjJlYmYwYzQyNyxNM3UzaTM0aw%3D%3D">Track everything</a>. Learn as much as possible. Use this data to inform not only improvements to the site in question but also to build you as a designer and enable you to make better decisions on future projects. Insight from your user&rsquo;s behavior is something you can&rsquo;t buy, treat them with respect and they&rsquo;ll make you a fantastic designer.</p>

<h3>Design with Beauty</h3>

<p>The web, the screen, can be a very cold place. The need for responsive design seems to have made matters worse. Typography and colors tend to be all so boring and predictable. Keeping the early focus on content, architecture, and copy, then designing in code can, if you&rsquo;re not careful, lead to a very&hellip;. dull and cold experience. It&rsquo;s the inevitable fate of careless modular design.</p>

<p>I think in order to accomplish &ldquo;beauty&rdquo;, it begins with understanding that style and substance are not enemies. Make them your friends. Figure out how to dance the crazy, confusing tango that they so often do.</p>

<p>People might not remember what it said or what it did, but they will always remember how it made them feel. (quote adapted because the internet). Only something that is as beautiful as it is useful will deliver that emotional reaction that makes something truly remarkable.</p>
