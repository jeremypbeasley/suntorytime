I was suspended in the first grade for drawing a penis on the wall outside the class room. 

At 15, my parents divorced. I never got over it. I was embarassed and alone. I found distraction in making things and listening to music more than anyone I knew. I found I could make money making things.

The Internet was smaller back then. I met a lot of people I didn't deserve to. My attemptys at design without any proper schooling was apparently interesting to some. Before I was legally old enough to have a bank account, I was cashing checks from the Wallflowers, Dashboard Confessional, and some other rather big artists I was pretty into. 

I kept doing work in the music industry, designing albums, t-shirts, and even websites and more digitaly stuff as people needed stuff. 

Eventually I got married and had a son. With another kid on the way, I barely made enough to pay the bills. I was angry because bands were making way more money than I was on my art. 

I walked to a local bank and asked for $4,000 with no credit or collateral. I have no idea how but we signed that afternoon. I launched a clothing company in the Fall of 2009 with a 3,000 sqft space I rented for five hundred bucks a month and a huge screenprinting and dying setup.

Things as well as could be expected with me at the wheel. We released dozens of shirts and sold thousands. I got to meet a ton of really interesting people. At the end of the day, running a business and the steadiness required wasn't what I was best at.

Eventually I sold the business and began looking for a full time position that would ideally allow me to create design work I was proud of without the stress of making sure we could pay basic bills. I found myself taking a job offer (for $20k a year more than I made as a freelancer) in Chicago at a small digital agency.
