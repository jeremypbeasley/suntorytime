      <p>I'm a product  <a href="http://dribbble.com/jeremypbeasley" target="_blank">designer</a> and  <a href="https://github.com/jeremypbeasley" target="_blank">front-end developer</a> currently helping lead the digital product design team at <a href="http://starbucks.com">Starbucks</a>. I previously worked with The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, HP, Intel, Microsoft, and a handful of lesser-known brands and <a href="http://iwantrest.com/" target="_blank">organizations</a> that I care an awful lot about.</p>
      <p>I have almost a decade of experience designing and building experiences for people on screens. My hope is that my work is ultimately making peoples' lives better in some way, shape, or form. I live and work in Seattle, WA with my wife, Amy, and our three amazing kids.</p>
      <p>Lately, I've been exploring <a href="http://instagram.com/jeremypbeasley" target="_blank">photography</a> and <a href="https://vimeo.com/jeremypbeasley">filmmaking</a>. I often post video stills to <a href="http://vsco.co/bsley/" target="_blank">VSCO</a>.</p>

      <p>Starbucks, Product Design Manager — 2015 to Present</p>
      <p>I joined Starbucks as part of an effort to entirely rebuild Starbucks experiences on the web. I work daily with our excellent engineering teams as we build a global <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=progressive+web+app&oq=progressive+web+app&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i61l3j69i59l2.2290j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">progressive web app</a> for over 40 markets. In addition to my role as designer, I also lead the strategy for the Web at Starbucks moving them from previously informational, promotion-driven sites to robust products that include Order Ahead, card management, payment, and many other features. Beyond web, I've helped hire and build a diverse cross-platform design team from a few to over 15 working across <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/starbucks/id331177714?mt=8">iOS</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.starbucks.mobilecard&hl=en">Android</a> and <a href="http://www.starbucks.com/">Web</a>. Together, we are building a new global design language for Starbucks, refining existing features, and inventing new exciting ones.</p>

      <p>Deloitte Digital, Associate Creative Director — 2013 to 2015</p>
      <p>My team was acquired by Deloitte Digital in the fall of 2013. As ACD, I led my design team towards the best solutions for our growing pool of clients. I worked between the account management and execution teams to turn the ideas we pitched into realities. Beyond serving on individual projects, I also served as the design lead for our studio being a throughput for design decisions on all studio projects as well as mentoring and leading our design practice.</p>

      <p>Banyan Branch, Design Director — 2012 to 2013</p>
      <p>Being a part of a small team meant not only directing "art" but defining what eventually became our UX and development practices. I played a key role in building a team of talented designers, developers and creatives. I was privileged to direct many great digital experiences for clients including Intel, Blue Nile, Microsoft, 
  Loreal, and more.</p>

      <p>Designkitchen, Designer — 2012</p>
      <p>Jumping between different roles, DK allowed me to not only design digital campaigns for their clients but also collaborate conceptually with the copywriters and developers to give the client above and beyond their expectations. My client focus included HP, United Airlines, and Motorola.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>Freelance Design & Development — 2006 to 2012</p>
      <p>I began my career quite early working full time as a designer/developer. Building my own clients in music and entertainment not only allowed me hone in my skills as a creative professional but also begin to  establish what I needed to manage a team on larger and higher visibility projects. Clients included Relativity Media, Sony/Universal Pictures, Coldplay, Bob Dylan, The Wallflowers, and dozens of other major label and independent music artists.</p>
